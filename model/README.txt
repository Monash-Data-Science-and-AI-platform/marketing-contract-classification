4. wandb version 0.12.9

Other Python Libraries required are:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. openpyxl
4. sklearn

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Model and transformers used:
1. nlpaueb/bert-base-uncased-contracts (pre-trained model)
2. TFBertForSequenceClassification (for fine-tuning and inference)
3. TFBertForMaskedLM(for further pre-training)
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Overview:
This model consist of 3 top-level files, which are: 

1. fine_tuning.py, which is for fine-tuning the model
2. pre_training.py, which is for pre-training the model for further fine-tuning
3. inference.py, which is for making inference based on the fine-tuned model

The model also consist of several folders, which are:

1. example: contains the example dataset and guide to run the python scripts with the example dataset
2. inference: contains the python module and output for inference.py
3. pre_training: folder for pre-trained model to be saved#######
4. Dataset: folder that contains all the datasets used in fine-tuning and pre-training
5. fine_tuning_saved: folder for saving fine-tuned model
6. modules: folder contains modules for fine-tuning and pre-training
7. output_result: folder for saving outputs from python scripts


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
File structures and relationships:

1. fine_tuning.py
-fine_tuning.py is use for fine-tuning the bert-based-uncased contracts model
-for experimentations, no changes is needed in this file, all parameters and paths are changed via json files
-Parameters are changed via parameter.json in modules/fine_tuning
-Paths are changed via path.json in modules/fine_tuning
-Output of the fine-tuning(loss,validation loss, epochs and confusion matrix) are printed to output_result folder
-all custom modules are contained in modules/fine_tuning 

2. pre_training.py
-pre_training.py is use to further pre-train the nlpaueb/bert-base-uncased-contracts model
-for experimentations, no changes is needed in this file, all parameters and paths are changed via json files
-Parameters and paths are changed via parameter.json in modules/pre_training
-all custom modules are contained in modules/pre_training

3. inference.py
-inference.py is use for making inference based on a fine-tuned model of nlpaueb/bert-base-uncased-contracts
-for inferencing, all parameters are changed in inference/inference.json
-no additonal custom modules are required

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Inferencing:

-for inferencing, in inference/inference.json:
-change "keys" to the keys suited to the fine-tuned model, the current fine-tuned model support keys of "DC","CA_1","CA_2","R&R","IE","Flex","None"
-change the "data_file_path" to the .xlsx or .csv file containing the sentences for inferencing
-if the inferencing model is changed:
	-change "model_path" to the .h5 file which the fine-tuned model is saved
	-change "config_path" to the config.json which is saved along with the fine-tuned model
-lastly, change the output file to a desired output text file's path

-run the inference.py file

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Fine-tuning:

-First, in modules/fine_tuning/parameter.json
	-define the "project_name" and "wandb_entity"
	-change "learning_rate" if needed to test on different learning_rate
	-change "keys" to suite the current experiment(without "None")
	-in "loss_function":
		-use "binary_crossentropy" for multi-class classification
		-use "categorical_crossentropy" for single-class classification
	-change "epochs" if needed
-Then, in modules/fine_tuning/path.json
	-define the .xlsx file for training in "training_data_path"
	-and .xlsx file for validation in "validation_data_path"
	-change "output_file_path" to the desired .txt file for the result to output
	-change "save_model_path" and "save_config_path" to the desired path for the model and its config.json to save
	-make sure that both "save_model_path" and "save_config_path" are paths to a folder but not specific file

-Run fine-tune.py for the fine-tuning of model

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Pre-training:

-in modules/pre_training/parameter.json
	-define the "project_name" and "wandb_entity"
	-change "learning_rate" if needed to test on different learning_rate
	-define the "preTraining_data_path" to the .csv or .xlsx file for pre-training
	-define the path for the pre-trained model to be saved in "save_model_path"

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Additonal details for fine-tuning + pre-training:

-after pre-training nlpaueb/bert-base-uncased-contracts, in modules/fine_tuning/path.json:
	-"model_path" to the saved pre-trained model( also found in modules/pre_training/parameter.json, "save_model_path")

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Additonal details for single class labelling vs multi-class labelling

-just change the "keys" in modules/fine_tuning/parameter.json to change from one another
-then, most importantly:
	-in "loss_function":
		-use "binary_crossentropy" for multi-class classification
		-use "categorical_crossentropy" for single-class classification
